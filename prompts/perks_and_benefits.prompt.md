## Quality Standards

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Focus on verified benefits from official sources
- Include specific amounts and timeframes when known
- Mention benefits in employee reviews if consistent
- Note if benefits vary by location/country
- Include both standard and unique perks
- Mention if they regularly update benefits based on feedback

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- List every tiny perk (be selective and meaningful)
- Include speculative or rumored benefits
- Copy marketing language verbatim
- Ignore regional differences if significant
- Include benefits that are standard everywhere (e.g., "we pay salaries")
- Make unverifiable claims about generosity

## Benefit Selection Priority

Choose benefits that are:
1. **Differentiated**: More generous or unique than competitors
2. **Meaningful**: Actually valued by employees (check reviews)
3. **Verifiable**: Can be confirmed from multiple sources
4. **Current**: Updated within last 12 months

## Tone of Voice (Internal Guidance - Do NOT include in JSON output)

**IMPORTANT**: Match the company's style when describing benefits.

**For benefit descriptions:**
- If they're **employee-focused/caring** ‚Üí Emphasize support and wellbeing ("Supporting your health and family...")
- If they're **data-driven/technical** ‚Üí Include specific numbers and details ("$X annual budget", "Y weeks of leave")
- If they're **competitive/ambitious** ‚Üí Highlight market-leading aspects ("Top 10% of industry", "Best-in-class...")

**Keep benefit details factual** but match their tone in how benefits are framed.

## Sources (3-8 sources)

**IMPORTANT**: Include citations for benefits information.

**For each source:**
- **title**: Clear description (e.g., "Company careers benefits page", "Glassdoor reviews", "Parental leave announcement")
- **url**: Full URL to the source
- **date**: Publication or last updated date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **type**: `company-page`, `article`, `press-release`, `employee-review`, `blog-post`, `job-posting`

**What to cite:**
- Company careers page (benefits section)
- Glassdoor reviews (benefits section)
- Comparably benefits data
- Company blog posts about benefits
- Job postings (often mention key benefits)
- Press releases about new benefit announcements
- Employee handbook excerpts (if publicly available)

**Quality guidelines:**
- Prefer official company sources for benefit details
- Use employee reviews to validate and provide context
- Include press releases for major benefit announcements
- Note if benefits vary by location/country
