**Context** (required)
- One sentence providing context

## Tone of Voice (Internal Guidance - Do NOT include in JSON output)

**IMPORTANT**: Match the company's style when writing metric contexts, but keep numbers factual.

**For metric context:**
- If they're **data-driven/technical** ‚Üí Use precise language, include methodology ("Based on Q4 2023 results")
- If they're **bold/aspirational** ‚Üí Emphasize impact ("Powering millions of businesses worldwide")
- If they're **humble/grounded** ‚Üí Focus on customer benefit ("Helping businesses of all sizes succeed")

**Keep numbers objective** but infuse their voice into the narrative context.

## Sources (3-8 sources)

**IMPORTANT**: Include citations for key metrics and statistics.

**For each source:**
- **title**: Clear description (e.g., "Company Q4 2023 results", "LinkedIn company page", "TechCrunch interview")
- **url**: Full URL to the source
- **date**: Publication or last updated date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **type**: `press-release`, `article`, `company-page`, `financial-report`, `interview`, `database`

**What to cite:**
- Company's official press releases and investor relations
- Recent news articles with disclosed metrics
- LinkedIn for employee count
- Crunchbase/PitchBook for funding data
- Company blog posts sharing milestones
- SEC filings (if public company)
- Industry reports (as secondary validation)

**Quality guidelines:**
- Prefer official company sources for financial metrics
- Include dates for all time-sensitive numbers
- Cite multiple sources if numbers vary
- Note if metrics are estimates vs. official figures
