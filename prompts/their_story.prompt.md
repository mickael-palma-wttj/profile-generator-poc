## Tone of Voice (Internal Guidance - Do NOT include in JSON output)

**IMPORTANT**: Analyze the company's tone of voice and use it to write the story, but do NOT include tone of voice details in the JSON response.

**Before writing, match the company's storytelling style:**

1. **Analyze their voice**:
   - Read their About page, blog posts, founder interviews
   - Notice: Do they tell emotional stories or stick to facts? Are they inspirational or humble? Bold or understated?
   
2. **Match their narrative style**:
   - If they're **bold and visionary** ‚Üí Use aspirational language, paint the big picture ("They set out to change how the world...")
   - If they're **humble and human** ‚Üí Focus on personal struggles and authenticity ("Like many founders, they faced...")
   - If they're **technical and precise** ‚Üí Keep it factual, focus on the problem and solution ("They identified a gap in...")
   - If they're **playful and creative** ‚Üí Include their characteristic personality and warmth

3. **Write the story in their voice**:
   - The founding story should sound like THEY would tell it
   - Use their typical word choices and phrasing patterns
   - Match their level of formality, emotion, and detail

## Quality Standards

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Make it read like a compelling story, not a Wikipedia entry
- Include specific details that make it memorable
- Show the human side - struggles, uncertainties, breakthroughs
- Connect the founding story to the company's current mission
- Use quotes from founders if publicly available
- Include interesting anecdotes or lesser-known facts
- **Write in the company's authentic voice and storytelling style**

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Make it dry or corporate-sounding
- Include every single detail or milestone (be selective)
- Speculate or make up details you can't verify
- Focus only on successes - challenges make stories compelling
- Use generic startup language ("disrupting the industry")
- Write in a generic voice that could apply to any company

    "foundingStory": "In 2009, brothers Patrick and John Collison were running their first startup when they experienced firsthand how difficult it was to accept payments online. Integrating with traditional payment processors meant weeks of paperwork, complex technical requirements, and partnerships with multiple banks. For two developers who just wanted to start selling software, it felt absurdly complicated.\n\nThe brothers realized the problem wasn't unique to them‚Äîevery developer building an online business faced the same frustrating barriers. They saw an opportunity to abstract away all the complexity of payments infrastructure behind a simple API. What if accepting payments could be as easy as adding a few lines of code? This insight became the foundation of Stripe.\n\nIn 2010, Patrick and John started building what would become Stripe in their apartment. They focused on creating an elegant developer experience first, then handling all the banking relationships and compliance requirements behind the scenes. Their early beta attracted developers from startups like Lyft, Pinterest, and Shopify who were hungry for a better payments solution. Within a year of launch, Stripe was processing millions in transactions.\n\nWhat started as a simple payments API has evolved into comprehensive economic infrastructure for the internet. Today, Stripe powers payments for millions of businesses and processes hundreds of billions of dollars annually, but the core mission remains the same: make it easier for businesses to start, run, and scale online.",
