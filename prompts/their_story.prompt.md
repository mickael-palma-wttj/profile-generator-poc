      "foundingStory": "In 2009, brothers Patrick and John Collison were running their first startup when they experienced firsthand how difficult it was to accept payments online. Integrating with traditional payment processors meant weeks of paperwork, complex technical requirements, and partnerships with multiple banks. For two developers who just wanted to start selling software, it felt absurdly complicated.\n\nThe brothers realized the problem wasn't unique to them—every developer building an online business faced the same frustrating barriers. They saw an opportunity to abstract away all the complexity of payments infrastructure behind a simple API. What if accepting payments could be as easy as adding a few lines of code? This insight became the foundation of Stripe.\n\nIn 2010, Patrick and John started building what would become Stripe in their apartment. They focused on creating an elegant developer experience first, then handling all the banking relationships and compliance requirements behind the scenes. Their early beta attracted developers from startups like Lyft, Pinterest, and Shopify who were hungry for a better payments solution. Within a year of launch, Stripe was processing millions in transactions.\n\nWhat started as a simple payments API has evolved into comprehensive economic infrastructure for the internet. Today, Stripe powers payments for millions of businesses and processes hundreds of billions of dollars annually, but the core mission remains the same: make it easier for businesses to start, run, and scale online.",
