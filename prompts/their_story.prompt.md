  <p>Airbnb was born in 2007 when <strong>Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia</strong>, two design school graduates struggling to pay rent in San Francisco, bought three air mattresses and turned their apartment into a makeshift bed-and-breakfast during a design conference when all hotels were sold out.</p>
  
  <p>They built a simple website called <strong>"Air Bed & Breakfast"</strong> and charged guests $80 a night, which included breakfast. The concept was radical—inviting strangers into your home for money—but they saw an opportunity to help people afford expensive cities while connecting travelers with local experiences.</p>
  
  <p>After bringing on technical co-founder <strong>Nathan Blecharczyk</strong>, they launched nationally but struggled to gain traction. The breakthrough came when they realized their photos were terrible, so they flew to New York and personally took professional photos of listings, <em>doing things that don't scale</em> to prove the concept worked.</p>
</div>
