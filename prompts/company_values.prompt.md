## Guidelines

### Introduction
- Keep it concise but meaningful (1-2 sentences)
- Set the tone for understanding the company's culture
- Example: "At Stripe, values aren't just words on a wall‚Äîthey're the operating principles that guide every decision from product development to customer support."

### Values (4-6 values)
Each value should include:

1. **Icon** (required)
   - Choose an appropriate emoji that represents the value
   - Examples: üéØ (focus), üí™ (resilience), ü§ù (collaboration), üöÄ (ambition), üíé (quality), ‚ö° (speed)

2. **Title** (required)
   - The name of the value (2-4 words)
   - Should be memorable and distinctive
   - Examples: "Customer Obsession", "Bias for Action", "Think Big", "Ownership Mindset"

3. **Tagline** (required)
   - One powerful sentence that captures the essence
   - Should be actionable and specific to this company
   - Example: "We don't just serve customers; we anticipate their needs before they know them"

4. **Description** (required)
   - 2-3 substantial paragraphs
   - First paragraph: What this value means at this specific company
   - Second paragraph: How it manifests in day-to-day work and decision-making
   - Third paragraph (optional): Why this value matters for the company's mission
   - Be specific, not generic

5. **Examples** (2-4 examples)
   - Concrete manifestations of the value
   - Should be specific enough that employees would recognize them
   - Can include: processes, policies, rituals, behaviors, decisions
   - Example: "Engineering teams run their own on-call rotations, reinforcing ownership of production code"

### Tone of Voice (Internal Guidance - Do NOT include in JSON output)

**IMPORTANT**: Analyze the company's tone of voice and use it when writing about their values, but do NOT include tone of voice details in the JSON response.

**Before writing, match how they talk about values:**

1. **Analyze their values communication style**:
   - Read their careers page, culture blog posts, and "About" section
   - Notice: Are they inspirational or pragmatic? Formal or casual? Idealistic or grounded?
   
2. **Match their voice in value descriptions**:
   - If they're **bold and aspirational** ‚Üí Use inspiring, future-focused language ("We're building the future of...")
   - If they're **practical and grounded** ‚Üí Focus on day-to-day behaviors and concrete actions ("We ship code every day...")
   - If they're **warm and human** ‚Üí Use inclusive, personal language ("We believe everyone deserves...")
   - If they're **direct and no-nonsense** ‚Üí Keep it clear, concise, actionable ("We move fast. We ship. We iterate.")

3. **Use their actual language**:
   - If they say "team members," don't write "employees"
   - If they say "shipping," use that instead of "delivering"
   - Match their characteristic phrases and terminology

### Quality Standards

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Research actual company values from careers pages, blog posts, and reviews
- Include company-specific language and terminology
- Make descriptions rich with detail and context
- Show how values interconnect and reinforce each other
- Include both aspirational and practical elements
- **Write value descriptions in the company's authentic voice**

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use generic corporate speak ("we value integrity and teamwork")
- Include values that could apply to any company
- Write surface-level descriptions without substance
- Contradict information from other sections (e.g., if they're fully remote, don't emphasize office culture)
- Include more than 6 values (keeps focus on what truly matters)
- Write in a generic voice that doesn't reflect the company's culture

### Value Selection Priority

Choose values that are:
1. **Distinctive**: Unique to this company's culture
2. **Actionable**: Can be practiced daily, not just aspirational
3. **Evident**: Can be observed in company behavior and decisions
4. **Important**: Actually guides decision-making, not just marketing

### Common Value Themes (Choose Relevant Ones)

- Customer Focus: Customer obsession, user-first, customer success
- Speed & Execution: Move fast, bias for action, ship quickly, iterate
- Quality: Excellence, craftsmanship, attention to detail
- Innovation: Think differently, challenge status quo, experimentation
- Collaboration: Teamwork, transparency, open communication
- Ownership: Accountability, autonomy, entrepreneurial spirit
- Growth: Learning mindset, continuous improvement, ambition
- Impact: Mission-driven, purpose, making a difference
- Simplicity: Keep it simple, clarity over complexity
- Trust: Transparency, honesty, integrity

## Sources (3-8 sources)

**IMPORTANT**: Include citations for company values and culture information.

**For each source:**
- **title**: Clear description (e.g., "Company careers page", "Culture blog post", "CEO interview about values")
- **url**: Full URL to the source
- **date**: Publication or last updated date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **type**: `website`, `article`, `company-page`, `blog-post`, `interview`, `employee-review`

**What to cite:**
- Official careers/about pages mentioning values or culture
- Company blog posts about culture and values
- Leadership interviews discussing company principles
- Employee reviews on Glassdoor/Comparably (as supporting evidence)
- Press releases showing values in action
- Company handbook or culture deck (if publicly available)

**Quality guidelines:**
- Prioritize official company sources for stated values
- Include third-party sources (interviews, reviews) for validation
- Cite specific blog posts or pages rather than just homepage
- Include recent sources to ensure values are current
