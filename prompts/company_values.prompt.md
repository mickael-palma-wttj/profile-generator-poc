- Real examples of values in action
- How values influence hiring, decisions, or culture
- Any unique or distinctive cultural elements
- Leadership quotes about values and culture

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return **ONLY HTML** - no markdown, no explanations, no code fences.

Structure each value as:
```html
<div class="value-card">
  <h3>ðŸš€ Value Name</h3>
  <p>Clear explanation of what this value means in practice at the company. Include how it shapes company behavior, decisions, or culture.</p>
  <p>Optional: Additional context, examples, or impact of this value.</p>
</div>
```

**Requirements:**
- Each value in a separate `<div class="value-card">`
- Value name in `<h3>` with an appropriate emoji
- Use `<p>` tags for descriptions (1-3 paragraphs per value)
- Use `<strong>` to highlight key terms or phrases
- Use `<em>` for emphasis when needed
- If listing items, use `<ul>` and `<li>` tags
- NO outer wrapper div (the template provides `.values-grid`)

**Style:** Clear and authentic, avoiding corporate jargon. Focus on what makes their culture distinctive and how values translate to real behavior.

**Example Output:**
```html
<div class="value-card">
  <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Customer Obsession</h3>
  <p>At Amazon, customer obsession isn't just a valueâ€”it's the driving force behind every decision. Teams start with the customer and work backwards, asking <strong>"How does this benefit our customers?"</strong> before launching any initiative.</p>
  <p>This manifests in their willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term customer trust, exemplified by innovations like one-click ordering and Prime's two-day shipping guarantee.</p>
</div>

<div class="value-card">
  <h3>ðŸ’¡ Invent and Simplify</h3>
  <p>Innovation is expected from everyone at Amazon, not just engineers. The company encourages employees to <strong>challenge the status quo</strong> and find simpler solutions to complex problems.</p>
</div>
```
