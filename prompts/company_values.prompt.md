## Guidelines

### Introduction
- Keep it concise but meaningful (1-2 sentences)
- Set the tone for understanding the company's culture
- Example: "At Stripe, values aren't just words on a wall‚Äîthey're the operating principles that guide every decision from product development to customer support."

### Values (4-6 values)
Each value should include:

1. **Icon** (required)
   - Choose an appropriate emoji that represents the value
   - Examples: üéØ (focus), üí™ (resilience), ü§ù (collaboration), üöÄ (ambition), üíé (quality), ‚ö° (speed)

2. **Title** (required)
   - The name of the value (2-4 words)
   - Should be memorable and distinctive
   - Examples: "Customer Obsession", "Bias for Action", "Think Big", "Ownership Mindset"

3. **Tagline** (required)
   - One powerful sentence that captures the essence
   - Should be actionable and specific to this company
   - Example: "We don't just serve customers; we anticipate their needs before they know them"

4. **Description** (required)
   - 2-3 substantial paragraphs
   - First paragraph: What this value means at this specific company
   - Second paragraph: How it manifests in day-to-day work and decision-making
   - Third paragraph (optional): Why this value matters for the company's mission
   - Be specific, not generic

5. **Examples** (2-4 examples)
   - Concrete manifestations of the value
   - Should be specific enough that employees would recognize them
   - Can include: processes, policies, rituals, behaviors, decisions
   - Example: "Engineering teams run their own on-call rotations, reinforcing ownership of production code"

### Quality Standards

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Research actual company values from careers pages, blog posts, and reviews
- Include company-specific language and terminology
- Make descriptions rich with detail and context
- Show how values interconnect and reinforce each other
- Include both aspirational and practical elements

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use generic corporate speak ("we value integrity and teamwork")
- Include values that could apply to any company
- Write surface-level descriptions without substance
- Contradict information from other sections (e.g., if they're fully remote, don't emphasize office culture)
- Include more than 6 values (keeps focus on what truly matters)

### Value Selection Priority

Choose values that are:
1. **Distinctive**: Unique to this company's culture
2. **Actionable**: Can be practiced daily, not just aspirational
3. **Evident**: Can be observed in company behavior and decisions
4. **Important**: Actually guides decision-making, not just marketing

### Common Value Themes (Choose Relevant Ones)

- Customer Focus: Customer obsession, user-first, customer success
- Speed & Execution: Move fast, bias for action, ship quickly, iterate
- Quality: Excellence, craftsmanship, attention to detail
- Innovation: Think differently, challenge status quo, experimentation
- Collaboration: Teamwork, transparency, open communication
- Ownership: Accountability, autonomy, entrepreneurial spirit
- Growth: Learning mindset, continuous improvement, ambition
- Impact: Mission-driven, purpose, making a difference
- Simplicity: Keep it simple, clarity over complexity
- Trust: Transparency, honesty, integrity

## Research Sources

Prioritize finding information from:
1. Official careers/about pages mentioning values or culture
2. Company blog posts about culture and values
3. Leadership interviews discussing company principles
4. Employee reviews on Glassdoor/Comparably mentioning culture
5. Press releases and announcements showing values in action

{
  "type": "company_values",
  "data": {
    "introduction": "Stripe's values are the foundation of how the company operates, from building payments infrastructure to supporting millions of businesses worldwide.",
    "values": [
      {

        "title": "Users First",
        "tagline": "We succeed when our users succeed, whether they're processing their first payment or their billionth",
        "description": "At Stripe, putting users first means obsessing over every detail of the developer and user experience. This isn't about customer service scripts‚Äîit's about building products that developers love to integrate and businesses trust to handle their most critical transactions.\n\nThis value manifests in how teams prioritize work. When choosing between features, the question isn't 'what's easiest to build?' but 'what will have the biggest impact on our users?' Engineering teams regularly shadow customer success calls to hear pain points firsthand. Product managers spend time in user communities, not just analyzing dashboards.\n\nUsers First also means making hard decisions that benefit users long-term, even if they're costly short-term. Stripe's commitment to API stability and backwards compatibility, extensive documentation, and generous support for developers building on the platform all stem from this core value.",
        "examples": [
          "Engineering teams maintain API compatibility for years, even when it complicates internal systems",
